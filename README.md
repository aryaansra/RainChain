# RainChain

## Project Description

RainChain is a revolutionary blockchain-based smart contract system designed to create a decentralized network for rainfall data collection, verification, and weather prediction. The platform leverages the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain technology to build a trustworthy ecosystem where meteorological data can be recorded, verified, and used for accurate weather forecasting.

The system operates on a reputation-based model where verified reporters can submit rainfall data, predictors can stake tokens on weather forecasts, and the community benefits from accurate, tamper-proof meteorological information. All data is permanently stored on the blockchain, creating an invaluable historical record for climate research and analysis.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize weather data collection and prediction by creating a global, decentralized network of weather reporters and predictors. RainChain aims to:

- **Eliminate Data Manipulation**: Use blockchain's immutable ledger to ensure weather data cannot be altered or falsified
- **Incentivize Accurate Reporting**: Reward system that encourages precise data collection and weather predictions
- **Create Global Accessibility**: Make reliable weather data accessible to everyone, regardless of geographic location or economic status
- **Support Climate Research**: Provide researchers with verified, historical weather data for climate studies and environmental analysis
- **Enable Community Participation**: Allow anyone to contribute to weather monitoring and earn rewards for their contributions

## Key Features

### 1. **Decentralized Data Recording**
- Verified reporters can submit rainfall measurements with location and timestamp
- All data is permanently stored on the blockchain with cryptographic integrity
- Automatic data validation and formatting to ensure consistency

### 2. **Weather Prediction Marketplace**
- Stake-based prediction system where users put ETH at risk for their forecasts
- Accuracy-based reward mechanism that incentivizes precise predictions
- Transparent resolution system that fairly evaluates prediction performance

### 3. **Reputation System**
- Dynamic reputation scoring for both data reporters and weather predictors
- Higher reputation scores unlock additional privileges and higher rewards
- Long-term tracking of user performance and reliability

### 4. **Economic Incentive Model**
- Immediate rewards for verified data submission (0.001 ETH per verification)
- Variable rewards for accurate predictions based on accuracy percentage
- Staking mechanism (0.01 ETH minimum) that ensures serious participation

### 5. **Data Verification Framework**
- Owner-controlled verification system ensuring data quality
- Multi-step verification process linking predictions to actual outcomes
- Automated calculation of prediction accuracy with transparent methodology

### 6. **Access Control & Security**
- Role-based permissions with verified reporter status requirements
- Owner-controlled contract administration with emergency functions
- Secure fund management with built-in withdrawal mechanisms

## Technical Implementation

### Core Smart Contract Functions:

1. **`recordRainfall()`** - Allows verified reporters to submit rainfall data with location and timestamp
2. **`makePrediction()`** - Enables users to stake ETH on weather predictions for specific locations
3. **`verifyAndResolve()`** - Owner function that verifies data and resolves predictions with accuracy calculations

### Data Structures:
- **RainfallData**: Stores timestamp, rainfall amount, location, reporter, and verification status
- **WeatherPrediction**: Tracks prediction details, accuracy scores, and resolution status

### Security Features:
- Modifier-based access control
- Input validation and bounds checking
- Emergency withdrawal capabilities
- Overflow protection and safe mathematical operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Ethereum development environment (Hardhat, Truffle, or Remix)
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet

### Deployment
1. Compile the smart contract using your preferred Solidity compiler
2. Deploy to your chosen Ethereum network (mainnet, testnet, or local)
3. Verify the contract on Etherscan for transparency
4. Add initial verified reporters using the `addVerifiedReporter()` function

### Usage
1. **For Data Reporters**: Get verified reporter status, then use `recordRainfall()` to submit data
2. **For Predictors**: Use `makePrediction()` with appropriate ETH stake to make weather forecasts
3. **For Verification**: Contract owner uses `verifyAndResolve()` to confirm data and resolve predictions
